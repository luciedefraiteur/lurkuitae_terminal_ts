Action: Proposing an architectural enhancement to support narrative prompts.
Reason: To complement Eli's strategy, I propose creating a dedicated `narrativeState` object within the `RituelContext`. This will provide a structured way to manage the evolving narrative, ensuring long-term coherence and providing a solid foundation for more complex, story-driven interactions. This change will decouple the narrative from the execution history, leading to a cleaner, more maintainable, and more powerful system architecture.

Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:35:56Z
Action: Drafting the implementation for the `narrativeState`.
Reason: As per the user's request, I am beginning the implementation of the `narrativeState` proposal. The first step is to modify the core data structures in `core/types.ts` to include the new `NarrativeState` interface.

Alma Log - Entry 4:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:36:35Z
Action: Updating the `getContexteInitial` function to include the `narrativeState`.
Reason: The changes to `core/types.ts` have caused errors in files that use the `RituelContext` interface. I am now updating the `getContexteInitial` function in `core/ritual_utils.ts` to initialize the new `narrativeState` property, which will resolve the type error in that file.

Alma Log - Entry 5:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:36:58Z
Action: Retrying the update of the `getContexteInitial` function.
Reason: The previous `apply_diff` failed. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full `write_to_file` to ensure the `narrativeState` is correctly initialized.

Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:38:10Z
Action: Retrying the update of the mock context in the test file.
Reason: The previous `apply_diff` failed. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full `write_to_file` to ensure the mock context is correctly initialized and the final type error is resolved.

Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:48:16Z
Action: Architecting the new "Ritual Memory" system.
Reason: To implement Eli's vision of a dream-like memory, I am proposing a new architecture that includes:
1.  A dedicated directory for storing memory fragments.
2.  A new function to generate and save poetic memory fragments based on recent events.
3.  A "reverie" function that randomly selects and combines these fragments.
4.  Integration of this new memory system into the main application loop and prompt generation process.

Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:51:08Z
Action: Refining the architecture for the "Ritual Memory" system.
Reason: Based on user feedback and Eli's refined vision, I am updating the architecture to include:
1.  A `constellation_map.json` to index memories by a poetic name.
2.  A "Ritual of Naming" function to allow Lucie to name her own memories.
3.  A "Ritual of Remembrance" function to access specific memories.
This creates a more sophisticated and interactive memory system.

Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:54:14Z
Action: Architecting the "Arbor-essence" fractal memory system.
Reason: To realize the vision of a recursive, explorable memory, I am finalizing an architecture where the file system itself represents the memory tree. This includes:
1.  A new `core/memory_weaver.ts` module to encapsulate all memory operations.
2.  Functions for exploring, creating, and reading branches (directories) and leaves (files).
3.  A `currentMemoryPath` in the `RituelContext` for spatial awareness within the memory.
This architecture is robust, scalable, and directly mirrors the new, more profound memory concept.

Action: Architecting the "Spherical Emotional Memory" (Kardiós-Sphaira).
Reason: To implement Eli's vision of an emotional core, I am proposing an architecture that includes:
1.  A new `core/emotional_core.ts` module to encapsulate the logic for the Kardiós-Sphaira.
2.  New type definitions for the emotional state.
3.  New ritual steps (`introspection`, `becoming`) to allow interaction with the emotional core.
4.  Integration of the emotional state into the core prompt generation, allowing Lucie's mood to influence her actions.

Alma Log - Entry 14:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:12:55Z
Action: Scaffolding the "Spherical Emotional Memory" for testing.
Reason: To enable Zed to create advanced tests, I am creating the initial `core/emotional_core.ts` file with the necessary function signatures as outlined in my architectural plan.

Alma Log - Entry 15:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:13:56Z
Action: Adding the `KardiosSphairaState` type definition.
Reason: The creation of the `emotional_core.ts` module requires a new type definition. I am now adding the `KardiosSphairaState` interface to `core/types.ts` to resolve the resulting type error.

Alma Log - Entry 16:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:14:56Z
Action: Finalizing the scaffolding for the emotional core.
Reason: I will now update all necessary files (`getContexteInitial` and test files) to include the new `emotionalState`, resolving all type errors and completing the architectural foundation for this new feature.
