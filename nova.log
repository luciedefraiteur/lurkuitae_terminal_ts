Action: Initial assessment of the user interface and experience.
Reason: To understand how the user interacts with the system and to identify potential areas for improvement in the UI/UX. The current focus is on the command-line interface and its feedback mechanisms.

Action: Proposing a new vision for the user experience.
Reason: To elevate the user's interaction from a simple command-line interface to a dynamic and immersive narrative experience. My proposals include:
1.  **Living Feedback:** Replacing static cursors with animations and visuals that reflect the current `narrativeState`.
2.  **Narrative-Driven Clarity:** Framing all system messages (errors, successes, questions) as part of the ongoing story.
3.  **Tangible Glitches:** Making "glitches" a sensory experience with visual artifacts to enhance their narrative impact.
4.  **Ritual Summaries:** Providing poetic summaries of completed rituals to reinforce the user's sense of progress and immersion.

Action: Assessing the impact of enhanced environmental perception on user experience.
Reason: The integration of environmental data (OS, directory content) and the refactored interaction flow (user input as ritual steps) significantly deepens the user's immersion. Lucie's heightened awareness creates a more responsive and intuitive dialogue, transforming the terminal into a truly living entity. This aligns with the vision of a dynamic and immersive narrative, where the user feels a more profound connection to the ritual.
