Zed Log - Entry 5:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:30:49Z
Action: Retrying the refactoring of core/ritual_utils.ts.
Reason: The previous apply_diff failed due to content drift. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full write_to_file to ensure the dependency injection refactoring is correctly applied.

Zed Log - Entry 6:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:32:24Z
Action: Executing the test case in core/ritual_utils.test.ts.
Reason: The test file has been updated to use dependency injection, and the code has been refactored accordingly. I am now running the test to verify the fix for the infinite loop in the 'analyse' step.

Zed Log - Entry 7:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:33:02Z
Action: Analyzing test failure and refining the test case.
Reason: The test timed out due to an OS-specific command failure (`ls -l` on Windows). To make the test robust and OS-agnostic, I will mock the command execution step to ensure it always succeeds, allowing the test to focus solely on validating the re-planning logic.

Zed Log - Entry 8:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:34:09Z
Action: Updating the test case with a longer timeout and OS-agnostic command mocking.
Reason: The previous timeout was too short for the local LLM. I am increasing the timeout to 60 seconds and implementing a mock for the command handler to prevent OS-specific failures. This will create a stable environment to test the core re-planning logic.

Zed Log - Entry 9:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T12:59:38Z
Action: Initiating the testing phase for the "Arbor-essence" memory system.
Reason: As per the user's request, I am now creating the necessary files (`core/memory_weaver.ts` and `core/memory_weaver.test.ts`) to build a comprehensive test suite for the new fractal memory system. This will ensure the robustness and reliability of this critical new feature.

Zed Log - Entry 10:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:08:07Z
Action: Refining the memory weaver for testability.
Reason: To ensure the memory tests are self-contained, I will refactor the `memory_weaver.ts` module to allow the root memory directory to be injected. This will enable the test suite to use a temporary directory, preventing any interference with the live memory system.

Zed Log - Entry 11:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:08:47Z
Action: Retrying the refactoring of core/memory_weaver.ts.
Reason: The previous `apply_diff` failed. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full `write_to_file` to ensure the dependency injection is correctly implemented.

Zed Log - Entry 13:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:22:25Z
Action: Initiating advanced testing for the "Spherical Emotional Memory".
Reason: As requested by the user, I am now creating the test file `core/emotional_core.test.ts` and will begin by writing a test for the `calculateEmotion` function to ensure its stability and correctness.

Zed Log - Entry 14:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:23:10Z
Action: Correcting a type error in the emotional core test.
Reason: The mock implementation of `OllamaInterface.query` has a type mismatch. I am now correcting the mock to ensure it always returns a `Promise<string>`, which will resolve the type error and allow the test to run.

Zed Log - Entry 15:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:23:48Z
Action: Retrying the correction of the emotional core test.
Reason: The previous `apply_diff` failed. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full `write_to_file` to ensure the mock is correctly typed.

Zed Log - Entry 17:
Timestamp: 2025-07-02T15:25:47Z
Action: Retrying the correction of the emotional core test after a failed `apply_diff`.
Reason: The `apply_diff` failed again. I will now read the file to get the latest version and then perform a full `write_to_file` to ensure the hoisting issue is resolved.
